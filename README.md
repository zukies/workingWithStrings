 /*THIS TEST DATA (pasted to textarea)
  
SHOULD PRODUCE THIS OUTPUT (5 separate console.log outputs)
underscore_case       
first_name          
Some_Variable        
calculate_AGE        
delayed_departure     
underscoreCase      âœ…
firstName           âœ…âœ…
someVariable        âœ…âœ…âœ…
calculateAge        âœ…âœ…âœ…âœ…
delayedDeparture    âœ…âœ…âœ…âœ…âœ…
HINT 1: Remember which character defines a new line in the textarea ðŸ˜‰
HINT 2: The solution only needs to work for a variable made out of 2 words, like a_b
HINT 3: Start without worrying about the âœ…. Tackle that only after you have the variable name conversion working ðŸ˜‰
HINT 4: This challenge is difficult on purpose, so start watching the solution in case you're stuck. Then pause and continue!
Afterwards, test with your own test data!
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
